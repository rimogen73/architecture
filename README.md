- Zaha Hadid Architects has once again surprised the world with a fantastic project inspired by migratory birds flying in a wedge pattern. This time we are talking about a grandiose Public Art Center in Zhuhai city. Located in one of the most dynamically developing regions of the world, the project is intended to become a multifunctional center for contemporary art, an art museum and a theater.

The team at Zaha Hadid Architects continues the construction of a new arts center in the southern Chinese city of Zhuhai, which has been put on hold due to the pandemic. The fantastic shapes of the new mixed-use building, called the Zhuhai Jinwan Civic Art Centre, echo the "chevron patterns of migratory birds" flying in a wedge over South China.

- According to the editorial board of Novate.ru, in spite of the significant delay, has already built a roof-overhang of staggering proportions - 100 thousand square meters. Under it, 4 large-scale objects - art museum, science center, a conference hall for 500 seats and a theater, designed for 1.2 thousand spectators. All four buildings (2 large and 2 small "wings") are symmetrically located around a central "plaza" where walkways, recreation areas, cafes, restaurants and showrooms will be arranged.

The lattice steel canopies above each of these buildings are configured by repetition, symmetry, and rescaling to meet the different functional requirements of each and depending on the orientation. The folded canopy roof itself will consist of prefabricated triangular panels made of perforated aluminum and double glass that will hide from both sun and rain and wind, but will not require additional lighting during the day.

- Technically, this original effect on the giant square was achieved through a prefabricated modular system with self-supporting parts. "Each building module of the roof is self-supporting and self-stabilizing. The repetition of the modules optimizes the process of prefabrication and assembly of the parts, and only their connection and fixing goes on the construction site," says Zaha Hadid Architects.
